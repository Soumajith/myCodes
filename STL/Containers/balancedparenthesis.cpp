/*A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (, ), {, }, [, or ].

Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., (, [, or {) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or }) of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: [], {}, and ().

A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched. For example, {[(])} is not balanced because the contents in between { and } are not balanced. The pair of square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, (, and the pair of parentheses encloses a single, unbalanced closing square bracket, ].

By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is balanced if the following conditions are met:

    It contains no unmatched brackets.
    The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.

Given

strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. If a string is balanced, return YES. Otherwise, return NO.

Function Description

Complete the function isBalanced in the editor below.

isBalanced has the following parameter(s):

    string s: a string of brackets

Returns

    string: either YES or NO

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer
, the number of strings.
Each of the next lines contains a single string

, a sequence of brackets.

Constraints
,where

1<n<1e3 +10    is the length of the sequence.
1<|s|<1e3+10    All chracters in the sequences âˆˆ { {, }, (, ), [, ] }.

Output Format
For each string, return YES or NO.

INPUT
{[()]}
{[(])}
{{[[(())]]}}
OUTPUT
YES
NO
YES
